# School 21 projects

There are two projects written in C language: Libft and Get next line.

In Libft I had to create C library. [Task description](https://github.com/romanovariya/21-libft-gnl/blob/master/libft.en.pdf)


In get next line the idea is to make a function that returns a line ending with a newline, read from a file descriptor. [Task description](https://github.com/romanovariya/21-libft-gnl/blob/master/libft.en.pdf)
